    There are Three Types of Data

        This is typically transactional data. For example, during an event registration we will collect
        data on dietary needs of the attendee. This is short-term data (i.e., it’s only used for the event itself, and
        once the event is done, it won’t be used again). It’s important to collect but it has a short shelf-life.

          Long-term data.
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p class="section__paragraph">
        One of the best examples of this type of data is certification or accreditation data. While all
        certification programs are different, a typical certification program has a join and renew date, and
        requirements for attaining and retaining the certification. So there is data collected over a much longer period
        of time, all of which needs to be saved until at least the next renewal period, if not longer.
        Another example is areas of interest or opt-ins/outs. These will change over time, but they are also used over
        the long-term.

          Useless data.
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p class="section__paragraph">
        Alas, too much of our databases are filled with truly useless data. One of the most common
        examples of this is demograhpic data. So many associations collect this data with the intent of using it (e.g.,
        race, gender, age, in order to report on “makeup” of the association membership) but too often never do. How
        many times have you filled out a registration form that included ten questions about who you are, and as you
        answered the questions you thought to yourself “What are they going to DO with this data?!?”
